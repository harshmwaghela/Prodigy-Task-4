# Prodigy-Task-4
To gain a better understanding of public opinion and sentiments toward particular topics or businesses, analyze and illustrate sentiment patterns in social media data.

# Data collection: 
Social media data on specific themes or businesses was gathered via APIs.
# Sentiment Analysis: 
To categorize the acquired data's sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral, natural language processing (NLP) techniques were applied.
# Visualization: 
To demonstrate sentiment trends and patterns over time, analytical graphics were developed.
Tools: Pandas, TextBlob, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Python (Jupyter Notebook), and more.

I learned a lot about processing real-world social media data and using NLP techniques to sentiment analysis from this project. The process of visualizing these sentiment patterns yielded a wealth of information on public opinion and sentiments toward the selected topics or businesses, highlighting the significance of data in comprehending consumer behavior.
